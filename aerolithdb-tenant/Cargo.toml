# AerolithDB DBaaS Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This document provides a detailed technical implementation plan to transform AerolithDB from a self-hosted database into a production-ready Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) platform. Based on the comprehensive readiness analysis, we have identified critical gaps and developed a phased approach to address them.

**Timeline**: 16-24 weeks  
**Priority**: Multi-tenancy → Self-service → Billing → Enterprise features  
**Team Size**: 2-3 full-stack developers  

## 📋 Pre-Implementation Requirements

### Development Environment Setup
```bash
# Ensure all dependencies are current
cargo build --workspace
npm install --prefix web-client

# Set up development databases for testing
./run-battle-test.ps1  # Verify multi-node functionality
```

### Required Tools and Services
- **Container Platform**: Docker Desktop or Podman
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (minikube for dev, cloud for prod)
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe account for traditional payments
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana setup
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for IaC

## 🏗️ Phase 1: Multi-Tenancy Foundation (Weeks 1-6)

### Week 1-2: Core Multi-Tenancy Architecture

#### 1.1 Create Tenant Management Module
```bash
mkdir -p aerolithdb-tenant/src
```
