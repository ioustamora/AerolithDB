//! # aerolithsDB Plugin Architecture
//! 
//! ## Overview
//! 
//! The aerolithsDB plugin system provides a comprehensive, secure, and extensible framework
//! for extending database functionality through dynamically loaded modules. This system
//! enables third-party developers and system integrators to add custom functionality
//! without modifying the core database engine.
//! 
//! ## Plugin Architecture
//! 
//! The plugin system is built on several key architectural principles:
//! 
//! - **Type Safety**: All plugins implement strongly-typed traits for compile-time safety
//! - **Security Isolation**: Configurable security policies control plugin capabilities
//! - **Event-Driven Architecture**: Plugins respond to system events and lifecycle hooks
//! - **Dynamic Loading**: Runtime plugin discovery, loading, and management
//! - **API Extensions**: Plugins can expose new REST/GraphQL endpoints
//! - **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup and resource isolation
//! 
//! ## Plugin Categories
//! 
//! The system supports multiple plugin categories, each with specialized interfaces:
//! 
//! ### Storage Plugins
//! - Custom storage backends (cloud providers, specialized databases)
//! - Data format extensions (compression, encryption, serialization)
//! - Backup and archival solutions
//! 
//! ### Query Plugins
//! - Custom query languages and syntax extensions
//! - Specialized aggregation and analytics functions
//! - Query optimization strategies
//! 
//! ### Security Plugins
//! - Authentication providers (LDAP, OAuth, SAML)
//! - Authorization policies and role-based access control
//! - Encryption and key management systems
//! 
//! ### Analytics Plugins
//! - Real-time metrics collection and processing
//! - Custom reporting and visualization
//! - Machine learning and data mining operations
//! 
//! ### Integration Plugins
//! - External system connectors (message queues, APIs)
//! - Protocol adapters (custom network protocols)
//! - Data synchronization and replication
//! 
//! ## Security Model
//! 
//! The plugin system implements a comprehensive security model:
//! 
//! - **Sandboxing**: Plugins run in isolated environments with limited system access
//! - **Permission System**: Fine-grained capabilities control what plugins can access
//! - **Code Signing**: Plugin verification through cryptographic signatures
//! - **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and I/O quotas prevent resource exhaustion
//! - **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of plugin operations for security monitoring
//! 
//! ## Event System
//! 
//! Plugins integrate with the database through a comprehensive event system:
//! 
//! - **Data Events**: Document creation, updates, deletions
//! - **Query Events**: Query execution, optimization, caching
//! - **System Events**: Node management, consensus decisions
//! - **Administrative Events**: Configuration changes, maintenance operations
//! 
//! ## Performance Considerations
//! 
//! - Plugin operations are asynchronous to prevent blocking core database operations
//! - Resource pooling and caching minimize plugin initialization overhead
//! - Hot-swapping allows plugin updates without system downtime
//! - Performance monitoring tracks plugin impact on system metrics
//! 
//! ## Development Guidelines
//! 
//! - Plugins should be idempotent and handle partial failures gracefully
//! - All plugin operations should include proper error handling and logging
//! - Resource cleanup is mandatory in plugin shutdown methods
//! - API endpoints should follow REST conventions and include proper documentation
