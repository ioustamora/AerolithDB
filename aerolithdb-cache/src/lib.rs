//! # aerolithsDB Intelligent Cache System
//!
//! This module provides a sophisticated multi-layer caching infrastructure designed for
//! distributed database environments. The cache system implements ML-driven prefetching,
//! adaptive TTL strategies, and hierarchical storage optimization to maximize performance
//! while minimizing memory footprint and network overhead.

/// machine learning features, compression settings, TTL strategies, and resource limits.
/// The configuration supports dynamic runtime adjustment for optimal performance adaptation
/// to changing workload patterns and system conditions.
///
/// ## Configuration Philosophy
///
/// The cache configuration follows a declarative approach where the desired behavior is
/// specified through high-level parameters, allowing the intelligent cache system to
/// adapt the implementation details automatically. This enables:
/// - **Workload Adaptation**: Automatic optimization for different access patterns
/// - **Resource Optimization**: Dynamic resource allocation based on system capacity
/// - **Performance Tuning**: Continuous adjustment of cache parameters for optimal performance
/// - **Operational Simplicity**: Minimal configuration required for typical deployments
///
/// ## Configuration Guidelines
///
/// ### Cache Hierarchy Design
/// - **Layer Order**: Configure from fastest to slowest (Memory → NVMe → Network)
/// - **Layer Selection**: Include layers that match your hardware and performance requirements
/// - **Capacity Planning**: Ensure each layer has appropriate capacity for your workload
/// - **Network Topology**: Consider network latency and bandwidth for distributed layers
///
/// ### Machine Learning Features
/// - **Prefetching**: Enable for read-heavy workloads with predictable access patterns
/// - **Pattern Analysis**: Most effective with workloads that have temporal or spatial locality
/// - **Model Training**: Requires warm-up period (1-24 hours) for optimal effectiveness
/// - **Resource Impact**: ML features consume additional CPU and memory (5-10% overhead)
///
/// ### Compression Strategy
/// - **Data Characteristics**: Most effective for text, JSON, and structured data
/// - **Access Patterns**: Higher compression for less frequently accessed data
/// - **CPU Trade-off**: Compression trades CPU cycles for memory and network efficiency
/// - **Algorithm Selection**: System automatically selects optimal algorithms per data type
///
/// ### TTL Strategy Selection
/// - **Adaptive**: Best for mixed workloads with varying data volatility
/// - **Fixed**: Predictable behavior for time-sensitive applications with known update patterns
/// - **LRU**: Optimal for memory-constrained environments with clear access hierarchies
/// - **Consistency Requirements**: Consider your application's tolerance for stale data
///
/// ### Memory Management
/// - **Allocation**: Set to 60-80% of available system memory for optimal performance
/// - **Overhead**: Account for 10-15% overhead for metadata and ML models
/// - **Shared Memory**: Consider other system components when setting limits
/// - **Dynamic Adjustment**: System can adjust allocation based on memory pressure
///

///
/// ### Promotion Triggers
/// - Multiple accesses within a time window
/// - High predicted access probability from ML models
/// - Cache miss patterns that suggest benefit from faster access
/// - Explicit prefetch decisions based on pattern analysis
///
/// ### Demotion Triggers
/// - Memory pressure requiring space reclamation
/// - Extended periods without access (cold data identification)
/// - Low predicted future access probability
/// - Data size optimization (moving large infrequently accessed objects)
///
/// ## Performance Impact
///
/// Layer transitions have different performance characteristics:
/// - **Memory → NVMe**: ~100μs promotion cost, enables ~10,000x faster access
/// - **NVMe → Network**: ~1ms promotion cost, enables ~100x faster access
