//! # aerolithsDB Security Framework
//! 
//! ## Overview
//! 
//! The aerolithsDB security framework implements a comprehensive zero-trust security model
//! designed for distributed database environments. This module provides:
//! 
//! - **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Every request is authenticated and authorized
//! - **Multi-Layer Encryption**: Data protection at rest, in transit, and in memory
//! - **Comprehensive Auditing**: Forensic-level security event tracking
//! - **Compliance Support**: GDPR, HIPAA, SOX, PCI-DSS framework adherence
//! - **Cryptographic Agility**: Multiple encryption algorithms with automatic rotation
//! 
//! ## Security Architecture
//! 
//! The framework operates on several key principles:
//! 
//! 1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers protect against various attack vectors
//! 2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal access rights for all entities
//! 3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security event detection and response
//! 4. **Cryptographic Standards**: Industry-standard encryption with regular key rotation
//! 5. **Compliance by Design**: Built-in support for regulatory requirements
//! 
//! ## Key Components
//! 
//! - `SecurityConfig`: Central configuration for all security policies
//! - `SecurityFramework`: Main orchestrator for security operations
//! - `AuditLevel`: Configurable audit logging granularity
//! - `ComplianceMode`: Regulatory framework enforcement
//! - `EncryptionAlgorithm`: Cryptographic algorithm selection
//! 
//! ## Operational Considerations
//! 
//! - Key rotation frequency balances security vs. operational overhead
//! - Audit level selection impacts storage and performance requirements
//! - Compliance modes enforce specific data handling and retention policies
//! - Zero-trust mode significantly increases security but adds latency
//! 
//! ## Security Threat Model
//! 
//! The framework protects against:
//! - Network-based attacks (man-in-the-middle, eavesdropping)
//! - Storage-based attacks (data theft, tampering)
//! - Insider threats (privilege escalation, data exfiltration)
//! - Compliance violations (data sovereignty, retention policies)
//! 
//! ## Integration Points
//! 
//! - Network layer: TLS termination and certificate management
//! - Storage layer: Encryption key management and data protection
//! - Query engine: Access control and query authorization
//! - Consensus layer: Secure distributed protocol implementation

/// Zero-trust security architecture and policy enforcement engine.
/// 
/// The SecurityFramework serves as the central orchestrator for all security operations
/// within aerolithsDB, implementing a comprehensive zero-trust security model that treats
/// every request as potentially hostile regardless of source.
/// 
/// ## Core Responsibilities
/// 
/// - **Authentication**: Verify the identity of all entities (users, services, nodes)
/// - **Authorization**: Enforce access control policies for all operations
/// - **Encryption**: Manage cryptographic operations for data protection
/// - **Auditing**: Track and log all security-relevant events
/// - **Compliance**: Enforce regulatory framework requirements
/// - **Key Management**: Handle cryptographic key lifecycle and rotation
/// 
/// ## Security Models
/// 
/// The framework supports multiple security models:
/// - Traditional perimeter-based security (default)
/// - Zero-trust architecture (recommended for production)
/// - Hybrid models with selective zero-trust enforcement
/// 
/// ## Threat Response
/// 
/// The framework provides real-time threat detection and response:
/// - Anomaly detection in access patterns
/// - Automatic threat mitigation and isolation
/// - Forensic data collection for security investigations
/// - Integration with external security information and event management (SIEM) systems
/// 
/// ## Performance Considerations
/// 
/// Security operations are optimized for minimal performance impact:
/// - Hardware-accelerated cryptographic operations where available
/// - Efficient key caching and rotation strategies
/// - Parallel security processing for high-throughput scenarios
/// - Configurable security levels to balance protection vs. performance
